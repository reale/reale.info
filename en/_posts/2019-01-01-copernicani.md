Copernicani is an independent association of students, workers, entrepreneurs, professors, researchers and politicians who have decided to turn their ideas into actions, to stimulate a culture of innovation and goad the parties transversally. We want to propose concrete and feasible policies to improve the prospects of our country, aware of the complexity and difficulties of the context.

We appreciate the method of transparty contamination used by the Radical movement to bring the theme of civil rights into the political debate; we will work in a similar way for the right to the future.

Innovation, young people, competition, the future are the key words for sustainable development to allow everyone to exploit the opportunities offered by a world in profound evolution.
