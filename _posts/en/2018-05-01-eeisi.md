EeISI European eInvoicing Standard in Italy (action n. 2017-IT-IA-0150) is a national project funded by the European Commission through the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) program.

AgID coordinates a group of Italian institutions and private partner, including the Agenzia delle entrate, Uniocamere, Intercent-ER, InfoCert e UNINFO which has been awarded funding for the project under the 2017 CEF Telecom Call - eInvoicing (CEF-TC-2017-3)

The goals of the EeISI project are twofold:

* the evolution of the national electronic invoicing systems in order to ensure compliancy with the European standard on electronic invoicing (EN 16931), mandatory for public administrations under Directive 55/2014;
* the adoption of eDelivery services defined at the European level by Italian public bodies and IT solution providers.

The project is coordinated by AgID and involves Italian public bodies and private partners: Agenzia delle Entrate, Intercent-ER, UnionCamere, UNINFO, and InfoCert. The main deliverables of the project are:

* the specifications of the Italian Core Invoice Usage Specifications (CIUS) which define the adoption of EN 16931 in the Italian domain, ensuring compatibility with the PEPPOL Billing 3.0 specification and the PEPPOL cross-border network;
* the translator from the formats required by EN 16931 (OASIS UBL and UN/CEFACT CII) into the national FatturaPA format and vice versa.

The project provides for the evolution of the Interchange System (SdI) and of the electronic invoicing systems of Intercent-ER, UnionCamere and Infocert which will integrate the CIUS and the translator.

In order to foster the use of the European standard on electronic invoicing by SMEs, the project involves the development of dedicated services. Specifically, UnionCamere will provide a service to enable the translation of invoices from the Italian national format (FatturaPA) into formats compliant with the European standard, and to deliver them to a cross-border recipient.
