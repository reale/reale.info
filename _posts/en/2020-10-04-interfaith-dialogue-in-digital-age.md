Albeit being myself an agnostic, I find it most inspiring that Pope Francis' lastest encyclic, *Fratelli Tutti*, explicitly quotes Ahmad al-Tayyeb whilst at the same time addressing some of the most striking aporias of the digital age.

As Luciano Floridi shows in *The Green and the Blue*, relationships are the very fabric of our age. Hence, I strongly believe that it is high time for us to step forth as facilitators of interfaith dialogue on innovation and digital transformation, for the world as the pandemic is shaping it cannot be but a pluralistic and diverse one, calling for constant mediation and careful balancing.
