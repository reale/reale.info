Václav Havel was not only a hero of democracy, the prime mover behind the Velvet Revolution and the true father of the Czech Republic.

He was at the same time one of the most influential world-class intellectuals of the last century and a quintessential Czech. His wonderful mocking of all the bureaucracy jargons, newspeaks and governmental gibberishes of world stands unmatched to this day.

As a writer, as an opinion-leader as well as a politician, he anticipated many of the most pressing issues of our age: anti-consumerism, humanitarianism, environmentalism, civil activism, and direct democracy.

He was, as the European Parliament aptly put it, an advocate of an undivided Europe.

He would have turned 84 today. *Všechno nejlepší, pane Prezidente.*
