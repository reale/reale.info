These slides were written for my talk at the Linux Day 2016 in Rome. They start with an overview of the intrinsic weaknesses that make so hard to design and implement a fully-fledged, general-purpose Bash library in Bash.

Then comes bird's eye survey of some outstanding specimina among the existing libraries, not without the occasional fragment of code.

Finally a working example is introduced: the bashlets library, a novel, work-in-progress modular extensible toolbox for Bash.
